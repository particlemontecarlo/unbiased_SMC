# Unbiased Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers
The following includes code to produce unbiased Monte Carlo estimates of expectations obtained using SMC or particle methods. The code is generic enough to specify a target which can be annealed towards.
## Tests
We advise testing the resampling, particle method and unbiased MCMC method separately. 
## Main functions
